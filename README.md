# COVID Cam TV
This project won Hack The North 2021!!!!


## Inspiration: 
Many businesses are struggling to currently find employees. Many of them donâ€™t want to pay employees to stand outside throughout the day counting as customers enter the doors to regulate the flow of traffic.
## What it does: 
Through a connected wireless camera, the software tracks the number of people who enter and exit the building. Once a critical number of people have entered the room, the software will alert the user that this capacity has been exceeded.
## How we built it: 
Python, Anaconda, OpenCV, Tensorflow.
## Challenges we ran into: 
It was incredibly difficult to actually make the OpenCV model to track people in real time instead of just detecting their presence in a video frame. This kept on giving us errors such as there being thousands of people in a room at a time, when only one person was in front of the camera. We cycled through not only half a dozen computer vision models, but we were eventually able to settle on one that would perform well enough for our prototype.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
The camera was working. It recognizes humans and it tracks the movement.
## What we learned: 
We learned about hardware components such as arduino OV7670, UNO R3. Then how to use anaconda and more of python, OpenCV, and tensorflow.
## What's next for Covid Cam TV: 
Building it in Tensorflow JS to not only make it compatible with more devices, but also run faster and on lighter systems for a smoother experience. We would also like to integrate more cameras and build a web app around it that would allow it to seamlessly integrate into the security system of the building.
